#+TITLE: How to Design Programs (HtDP) - 2nd edition

This repository gathers my notes and solutions to exercises for the
book [[https://www.htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/][How to Design Programs]] (HtDP).

These files are currently being converted from Dr. Racket's format to
a "plain" format . Have a look at [[https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode][~racket-mode~ for Emacs]] which
provides a similar experience to Dr. Racket.
